## Install
````console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/Frodo-Web/Nightbreed.git
foo@bar:~$ cd ./Nightbreed
foo@bar:~$ npm install
````
## Run
````console
foo@bar:~$ npm run web // Wait until "listening on port 8080" output
````
Make sure 8080 port is free and opened on your device.
Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (OR <http://your_device_ip:8080>) in your browser, ensure your browser is not using https-only mode for this page, otherwise radio functionality will not work.

## Disable HTTPS-only mode in Firefox. Required for radio functionality.
This is because Nightbreed Radio is using http protocol for data-streaming. Radio will not work if your browser is configured with HTTPS-only mode, so you need to disable this option for this particular page http://127.0.0.1:8080 (OR <http://your_device_ip:8080>). Or simply use another browser. <br>
